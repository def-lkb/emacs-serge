synopsis: "A toolkit for communicating with Emacs"

description: """
Sturgeon implements various tools for manipulating Emacs from OCaml:
- `Sturgeon_sexp` implements the Emacs dialect of S-expressions
- `Sturgeon_session` implements an "session protocol" to make RPC to Emacs from OCaml and vice versa
- `Sturgeon_stui` is a session implementing an [Inuit](https://github.com/let-def/inuit) backend: one can now runs text user-interface on an Emacs buffer
- `Sturgeon_recipes_*` offers different "rendez-vous" points to connect to Emacs

Sturgeon is distributed under the ISC license."""

Add opam emacs directory to your load-path if it is not there yet:
  (let ((opam-share (ignore-errors (car (process-lines "opam" "config" "var" "share")))))
   (when (and opam-share (file-directory-p opam-share))
    (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "emacs/site-lisp" opam-share))))

Load sturgeon file:
  (require 'sturgeon)"""
